## what is the probability of a positive change multiple days in a row?   

```{r multiple day runs}

#prob of any positive day?
prob = 

#probability of 2 days in a row with positive change? 


#probability of 5 days in a row with positive change? 



```

## how often did multiple days of 1 percent actually happen?    

```{r multiple day runs empirical}

RC = data.frame(length = seq(1,10,1), 
        count = rep(0,10), #observed counts in the data
        simCount = rep(0,10), #based on random simulation of data
        shuffCount = rep(0,10), #based on shuffling the data
        multCount = rep(0,10)) #based on multiplication rule

#count how often consecutive positive days happen: 


RC$dummy = as.factor(1)
ggplot(RC, aes(x = length, y = count, color = dummy)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 2) + myTheme + brightCol + 
  theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
  ylab('probability')


```

## was this as often as would be expected by chance?    

```{r multiple day runs simulated}


for(ii in 1:(length(df$Change)-9)){
  for(runLen in 1:10){
    RC$simCount[   ]
  }
}


longVals <- RC %>% pivot_longer(cols = c('count', 'simCount'),
                          names_to = 'dataType', 
                          values_to = 'prob')

ggplot(longVals, aes(x = length, y = prob, color = dataType)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 2) + myTheme + brightCol


```

## was this as often as would be expected in shuffled data?   

```{r multiple day runs in shuffle}




longVals <- RC %>% pivot_longer(


```
## was this as often as would be expected if we just use multiplication rule?  

```{r multiplication rule calculation}



longVals <- RC %>% pivot_longer(
