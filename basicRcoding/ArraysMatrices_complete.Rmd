## set environment

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Set rendering parameters
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)



```

## creating and indexing in matrices works like vectors but with two dimensions

```{r make a matrix}
x = matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow=2, ncol=2)
#describe in words how the items 1,2,3,4
#got placed into the 2 rows and 2 columns:

#note that the print out gives us clues 
#about indexing
x
x[1,]
x[,1]

#you can also create an empty matrix
#and fill it later
y = matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
y
y[1,2] = 1

```
## switching to row major orientation
```{r populating matrices along rows}

#you can switch from column major order
#to row major order:
z = matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), nrow = 2, byrow = T)


```

## you can do math operations on whole matrices like on vectors with some extras
```{r matrix math}

#basic linear algebra operations are easy:
x %*% z #matrix multiplication
x + x  #addition
x*3 #scalar multiplication


```

## matrices are vectors with row and column attributes
```{r matrix vector relationship}
#R thinks of matrices as vectors
#that just have row and column attributes
attributes(z)
length(z)
z[4]
#you can also flatten a matrix into a vector
z = c(z)
z[4]

```

## adding rows and columns to matrices
```{r rows and columns}

#you can add whole rows or columns:
cbind(m, c(100,100))
rbind(m, c(1,2,3,4,5))

#combining types makes for coercion 
cbind(m, c('hello', 'there'))
cbind(m, c(T, F))
```
## recycling in matrices
```{r recycling}
#recycling happens in matrices like vectors
matrix(c(1,2), nrow = 3, ncol =2)

#can you leverage recycling to make a matrix
#with nrow= 5 and ncol=5 where each column
#is 1,2,3,4,5? 

#your code here :)

#can you combine recycling and byrow to make
#a matrix with nrow=5 and ncol=2 where each
#row is 1,2? 

#your code here :)
```
##dimensions can get dropped and break your code
```{r dimension dropping}
#being careful about dropping dimensions
r = m[1,]
str(r)
str(m)
attributes(r)
attributes(m)
#you may need r to stay as a 1 X 5 MATRIX
r = m[1,,drop = F]
str(r)
attributes(r)
```

## arrays (matrices with more than 2 dimensions)
```{r arrays}
#lastly, just a quick note on arrays! 
a = array(c(1:18), dim = c(2,3,3))

#can you describe in words how the data
#were placed into the array? 


```
