## set environment

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Set rendering parameters
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)



```

# Using R like a calculator
```{r doing basic math operations}

#addition
1 + 1

#subtraction
5-2

#multiplication
3*5

#division
7/2

#modulo
7%%2


```

# Use R to write out algebraic formulas and solve


```{r algebra example}
#basic algebra
#can you solve 15 = x*3 ? 
x = # try out an answer

#test your answer
x*3


```

# Exponents are a bit more complex but easy to use in R

```{r exponents}
#exponents
3^2

#law of exponents
3^2 * 3^4

3^(2+4)

#negative exponents mean reciprocal 
3^-1

1/3



```

# R can allow you to do many computations at once

```{r vectorization}
#using the power of R to solve 
#many problems at once! Vectorization
x = c(4,7,2,9) #this is a vector

x + 1

x^2

x%%2


```

# some mathematical calculations are impossible

```{r finite, infinite, nan}
#sometimes, a mathematical operation doesn't
#work as expected and produces strange results
c(-1, 0, 1) / 0
#These special values can cause issues in your
#analysis. You can check for them
x = c(-1,0,1) / 0
is.finite(x)
is.infinite(x)
is.nan(x)
is.na(x)
#these functions give you True and False output
#to help you understand where special values
#happen in your data, more on this later!


```

## example with an image as a matrix
```{r image as a matrix}

library(pixmap)
setwd("G:\\My Drive\\Teaching\\stats\\RCourse\\data")
cas = read.pnm('casablanca.pgm')
mode(cas)
str(cas)
image(t(apply(cas@grey, 2, rev)), col = gray.colors(20))
hist(cas@grey)
plot(cas)
dim(cas@grey)
#let's blow out a corner to find where is 1,1
cas@grey[1:50, 1:50] <- 1
plot(cas)
locator()
#It looks like the x direction (the columns)
#lines up with the matrix, but the y direction
#(the rows) are flipped! 
cas@grey[90: 115, 
         330:370] <- 1
plot(cas)
#can you blow out the other two corners? 
cas@grey[1:50, dim(cas@grey)[2]-50:dim(cas@grey)[2]] <- 1 
  
plot(cas)
#your code here :)

#what about using the locator to find 
#Humphrey Boghart's face and then blowing
#it out? 

#your code here :)
```
