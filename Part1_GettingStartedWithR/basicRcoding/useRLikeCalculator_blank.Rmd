## set environment

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Set rendering parameters
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)



```

# Using R like a calculator
```{r doing basic math operations}

#addition
1+2

#subtraction


#multiplication


#division


#modulo



```

# Use R to write out algebraic formulas and solve


```{r algebra example}
#basic algebra
#can you solve 15 = x*3 ? 
#x = # try out an answer

#test your answer



```

# Exponents are a bit more complex but easy to use in R

```{r exponents}
#exponents


#law of exponents
3^2 * 3^4



#negative exponents mean reciprocal 


1/3



```

# R can allow you to do many computations at once

```{r vectorization}
#using the power of R to solve 
#many problems at once! Vectorization
x = c(4,7,2,9) #this is a vector




```

# some mathematical calculations are impossible

```{r finite, infinite, nan}
#sometimes, a mathematical operation doesn't
#work as expected and produces strange results
c(-1, 0, 1) / 0
#These special values can cause issues in your
#analysis. You can check for them
x = c(-1,0,1) / 0
is.finite(x)
is.infinite(x)
is.nan(x)
is.na(x)
#these functions give you True and False output
#to help you understand where special values
#happen in your data, more on this later!


```
