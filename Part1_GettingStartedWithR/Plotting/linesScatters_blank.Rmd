## set environment

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Set rendering parameters
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

gitHubPath <- file.path(path.expand("~"), "GitHub",

## Plot miles per gallon as a function of engine size in R's builtin mpg dataset

```{r plotting}

head(mpg)
unique(mpg$drv)

#R's builtin plot function makes a pretty ugly plot: 
plot(mpg$displ, mpg$hwy)

#ggplot style plot
ggplot(
#grammar check, which of these did we specify and which were automatic? 
#data
#geometric object
#mapping
#scale
#coordinate system
  

```  
  
## Add titles to the plot
  
```{r adding titles}  



```

## Put a plot in a variable to make it easier to edit
  
```{r plot in a variable}  

p = 

p + 



```

## What about a line plot? 
  
```{r line plot}  

p +
#what's wrong with this graph? 



#what's wrong with this plot? 
#plot only Volkswagon Jetta data alone to see


#let's summarize with an average over all values of a model in a year
plotDat = mpg %>% 



```

## Plot covid data using ggplot
  
```{r covid ggplot}  

covidDat <- read.csv(file.path(gitHubPath, "data", 
                       "owid-covid-data.csv"))

covUSA <- covidDat %>% filter(iso_code == 'USA')




#grammar check, which of these did we specify and which were automatic? 
#data
#geometric object
#mapping
#scale
#coordinate system


```

## Changing the coordinate system
  
```{r polar plot}  

p + 
#just so we can say we edited every element 


```
