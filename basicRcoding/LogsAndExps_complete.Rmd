## set environment

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Set rendering parameters
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)



```

## Working with natural exponents has a special builtin function: exp

```{r natural exponents and logs}

#exponentiation or raising the natural number e to the x
#make a sequence of x values to test with
x = seq(from = 0,to = 10, by = .1)
#alternative syntax: 
x = seq(0,10,.1)

#raise e to the x
y = exp(-1*x)

#what is this value e? 
exp(1)

```

## Sneak preview of using data.frames and plotting
```{r add scatter plot rend}

 #combine into a single data frame
dat = data.frame('x' = x,'e.x' = y)

#plot values of e raised to the x
dat %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = e.x), 
             size = 3) + 
  ylab('e^x')



```

## taking the log of something is the inverse of exponentiation

```{r log v exponentiation}

#1 = log(x, base = exp(1)) 
#what is x? 

exp(1)
log(2.71, base = exp(1))

#base = exp(1) is default
log(2.71)

#even more concretely, we can be sure that these operations are inverses: 
log(exp(10))
exp(log(10))


```

## Let's build intuition for log values using a plot

```{r log x plot}

dat$logx = log(x)
dat %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = logx), 
             size = 3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = .1)  +
  geom_vline(xintercept = .2)  +
  geom_hline(yintercept = log(.1))  +
  geom_hline(yintercept = log(.2))  


```

## Can log(x) and exp(x) values be negative? 

```{r log and exp negatives}
log(-1)
#is there ever a negative result to the exp() function? 
exp(-1)
-2^2

```
## mini project using logs and real data

```{r COVID data and log scaling}
#we've just seen examples dealing with logs and exponents using base e
#let's look at it with base 10 and with some real data

#question: when during the pandemic was the US experiencing an increasing rate
#of covid spread? 
#data obtained from: https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv
#data downloaded on: 17/11/2021

covidDat <- read.csv('G:\\My Drive\\Teaching\\stats\\RCourse\\mathPrereqs\\owid-covid-data.csv')
covUSA <- covidDat %>% filter(iso_code == 'USA')

#make a plot
plot(as.Date(covUSA$date), covUSA$total_cases)


#what happens if we plot it on a logarithmic y axis? 
plot(as.Date(covUSA$date), log(covUSA$total_cases, base = 10))

 
#why in the regular scale does it look like it's changing more towards the end, 
#but in the log scale it looks like it's changing more towards the beginning? 
#remember standard number scale is about the absolute number of cases
#the log scale tells us more about the multiplicative scale or the order of magnitude
#what this tells us is that the multiplicative growth rate in covid cases was much larger early in the pandemic
#let's assess this by asking, what is the multiplicative relationship between
#one day's covid case count and the day before's? 
#use vectorization math like we did before, but now, we want to ask, what's the relationship between each day and the day before?
covUSA$growthRate = NA
L = length(covUSA$growthRate)
covUSA$growthRate[2:L] = covUSA$total_cases[2:L] / covUSA$total_cases[1:L-1]


plot(as.Date(covUSA$date), covUSA$growthRate)




#reminder for thinking about log scale: 
log(1000000, base = 10)
log(1e6, base=10)

#what is 7 on a log base 10 scale? 


#can you generate a similar set of plots for the running death count? 
#can you generate a similar set of plots for another country? Take a look in 
#the covidDat variable to find the iso_code you need for your target country

```
## Can log(x) and exp(x) values be negative? 

```{r log and exp negatives}
log(-1)
#is there ever a negative result to the exp() function? 


```
