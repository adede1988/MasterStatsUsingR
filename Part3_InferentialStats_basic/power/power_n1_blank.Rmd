## Example 1: hypothetical heights 

```{r height example}

M_mean = 70
F_mean = 65
all_sd = 3

#What is the probability that a random man will be taller than 95% of women?

#how tall is a woman in the 95th percentile? 


#what is the probability that a random man will be taller than W95? 
power = 1-pnorm(

print(paste0("The power of detecting men taller than",
             " women with one observation is: ", 
             round(power, 2)))

```

## Example 2: varying the true difference in heights

```{r varying dif}

M_mean = seq(65,75,1)
F_mean = 65
all_sd = 3

#What is the probability that a random man will be taller than 95% of women?

#how tall is a woman in the 95th percentile? 


#what is the probability that a random man will be taller than W95? 
power = 1-pnorm(

df = data.frame(power = power,
                TrueDif = M_mean - F_mean)
df %>% ggplot(aes(x = TrueDif, y = power)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 2, color = 'green') + 
  myTheme 


```

## Example 3: thinking in terms of effect size

```{r effect size}

M_mean = seq(65,75,1)
F_mean = 65
all_sd = 3

#convert differences to Cohen's d effect size values
cohenD = 

#What is the probability that a random man will be taller than 95% of women?
 
zCrit = qnorm(.95)

#what is the probability that a random man will be taller than zCrit? 
power = 1-pnorm(

df = data.frame(power = power,
                TrueDif = M_mean - F_mean)

df %>% ggplot(aes(x = TrueDif, y = power)) + 
  geom_line(linewidth = 2, color = 'green') + 
  myTheme 

#How big would the true difference 
#between men and women need to be 
#in order to have an 80% chance of 
#detecting it with n = 1?
