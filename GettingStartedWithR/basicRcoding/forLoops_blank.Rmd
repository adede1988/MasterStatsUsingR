## set environment

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Set rendering parameters
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)



```

## Doing a calculation for every observation in a set of data

```{r repeating a calculation}



```
## repeating code is slow, hard to read, and error prone, use a loop! 
```{r the for loop}




```

## R lets you make this even simpler by avoiding indexing
```{r direct iteration}




```

## what if we don't always want to loop every value? 
```{r breaking out of the loop}

 


```
## find runs of 1s with length equal to 2
```{r runs of 1s}





```
## simplify with the all function
```{r all any}






```
